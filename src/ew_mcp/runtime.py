"""Process entry point: transport selection, health route, transport security.

NOTE: this file is deliberately duplicated in the sibling edp-mcp repo.
The two servers are deployed independently and may diverge, but the security
behaviour below should not drift by accident — the `_transport_security` empty
allow-list trap in particular. Change it here, check the twin.

Transport is stdio by default, which is what local MCP clients and the tests
speak. Set MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http to serve over HTTP for a hosted
deployment.
